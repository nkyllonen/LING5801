### Here are regular expressions for classes of things like vowels and
### consonants to use in later expressions.

define Vowel [a|e|i|o|u|I] ;
define Consonant [b|c|d|f|g|h|j|k|l|m|n|p|q|r|s|t|v|w|x|y|z] ;

### Create an FST that contains the Finnish noun stems (see finnish_nouns.txt).


### Create an FST that relates underlying Number and Case values to
### their surface realizations and concatenate it with the FST for the
### noun stems. Number values and +Sg, +Pl and Case values are +Nom,
### +Part. In the end you should have an FST called FinnishNouns that
### relates forms like "maa+Pl+Part" to "maaITa".





### Implement rules for realizing underlying forms correctly and compose them in the correct order.



### Push your final RE "FinishNouns" onto the stack, ready for use.
